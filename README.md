# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

For this project, I created an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which provides information about the microorganisms found in human navels. The dataset is in JSON format, but retrieved using a url link.

The analysis of the dataset revealed that a small number of microbial species, known as operational taxonomic units (OTUs), were present in over 70% of the individuals, while the remaining species were relatively rare.

The dashboard dynamically displays demographic information based on the selected test subject ID. When the ID is changed, the bar chart, bubble chart, and a bonus gauge chart are automatically updated. To implement this functionality, I utilized Plotly, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js in the code.
